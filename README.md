🔭Data Scientist

My work with data has been marked by a diversity of projects from academic areas, such as biological sciences, health and precision agriculture, to the business world with e-commerce, self-service channels and IVR. This gave me a multidisciplinary mind that helps me in the search for solutions to problems. I have a deep interest in learning new things and applying scientific methods to problem solving through experimental design and hypothesis testing.


My main interests are:

Time series studies, 
Machine Learning, 
Deep Learning RNN, LSTM, 
Python, R , 
Single and Multiple Linear Regression, 
Cluster Analysis, 
Factor Analysis,
TensorFlow and TensorBoard.
