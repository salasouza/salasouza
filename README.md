ðŸ”­Data Scientist


I'm a Data Scientist, with 4 years of experience in Data Analyst and Data Analytics. I worked in contexts of precision agriculture, healthcare, e-commerce, ura and self-service channels. I have solid knowledge in Exploratory Data Analysis, Unsupervised Learning, Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, Pyspark, Python and R. I'm interested in understanding the relationship between data and questions using hypothesis testing and how to convert raw data into information and knowledge.

I believe that the scientific method is an important step towards doing good data science and bringing great business solutions. I am very interested in experimental design, statistical analysis and multidisciplinary knowledge to better understand problem solutions.
